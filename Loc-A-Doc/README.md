Won for best Social help app at SharkHack 2019

Web app using angular 8 aimed at international students looking to navigate 
US healthcare. User selects type of doctor and gets list of doctors near 
them.

Uses Angular 8, HTML, CSS. Uses an API to get city location 
of user.


For future: 
1) use coordinates instead of just city for location to narrow location
2) import data of doctors based on doctor type choice
3) sort by distance from user
4) rather than asking where user is from, ask if they are familiar with 
insurance as it is in the US
